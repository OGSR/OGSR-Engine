<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Boost Filesystem Library provides portable facilities to query and 
manipulate paths, files, and directories.</p>

<p>The motivation for the library is the need to be able to perform portable script-like operations from within C++ programs. The intent is not to 
compete with Python, Perl, or shell languages, but rather to provide portable filesystem 
operations when C++ is already the language of choice. The <a href="design.htm">
design</a> encourages, but does not require, safe and portable filesystem usage.</p>

<p>The Filesystem Library supplies several&nbsp; headers, all in 
directory boost/filesystem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Header <i><a href="../../../boost/filesystem/path.hpp">path.hpp</a></i> provides class <i>path, </i>a portable mechanism for representing
      <a href="#path">paths</a> in C++ programs. Validity checking 
      functions are also provided. See <a href="path.htm">path.hpp documentation</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Header <i><a href="../../../boost/filesystem/operations.hpp">operations.hpp</a></i> provides functions operating on files and directories, 
  and includes class <i>directory_iterator</i>. See <a href="operations.htm">
  operations.hpp documentation</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Header <i><a href="../../../boost/filesystem/fstream.hpp">fstream.hpp</a></i> provides the same components as the C++ Standard 
  Library's <i>fstream</i> header, except 
      that files are identified by <i>path</i> objects rather that <i>char *</i>'s. 
  See <a href="fstream.htm">fstream.hpp documentation</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Header <i><a href="../../../boost/filesystem/exception.hpp">exception.hpp</a></i> provides class <i>filesystem_error</i>. See
  <a href="exception.htm">exception.hpp documentation</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Header <a href="../../../boost/filesystem/convenience.hpp">convenience.hpp</a> 
  provides convenience functions that combine lower-level functions in useful 
  ways. See <a href="convenience.htm">convenience.hpp documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The object-library source files (<a href="../src/convenience.cpp">convenience.cpp</a>,
<a href="../src/exception.cpp">exception.cpp</a>,
<a href="../src/operations_posix_windows.cpp">operations_posix_windows.cpp</a>, 
and <a href="../src/path_posix_windows.cpp">path_posix_windows.cpp</a>) are 
supplied in directory libs/filesystem/src. These source files implement the 
library for POSIX or Windows compatible operating systems; no implementation is 
supplied for other operating systems. Note that many operating systems not 
normally thought of as POSIX or Windows systems, such as mainframe legacy 
operating systems or embedded operating systems, support POSIX compatible file 
systems which will work with the Filesystem Library.</p>
<p>The object-library can be built with a <a href="../build/Jamfile">Jamfile</a> 
supplied in directory libs/filesystem/build.</p>
<h2>Two-minute <a name="tutorial">tutorial</a></h2>
<p>First some preliminaries:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>#include &quot;boost/filesystem/operations.hpp&quot; // includes boost/filesystem/path.hpp
#include &quot;boost/filesystem/fstream.hpp&quot;    // ditto
#include &lt;iostream&gt;                        // for std::cout
namespace fs = boost::filesystem;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="path.htm#synopsis">class <i>path</i></a> object can be created:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>fs::path my_path( &quot;some_dir/file.txt&quot; );</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The string passed to the <i>path</i> constructor is in a
<a href="path.htm#Grammar">portable generic path format</a>. Access functions 
make <i>my_path</i> contents available in an operating system dependent format, 
such as <code>&quot;some_dir:file.txt&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;[some_dir]file.txt&quot;</code>,
<code>&quot;some_dir/file.txt&quot;</code>, or whatever is appropriate for the  
operating system.</p>
<p>Class <i>path</i> has conversion constructors from <i>const char*</i> and <i>
const std:: string&amp;</i>, so that even though the Filesystem Library functions in 
the following code snippet take <i>const path&amp;</i> arguments, the user can just 
code C-style strings:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>fs::remove_all( &quot;foobar&quot; );
fs::create_directory( &quot;foobar&quot; );
fs::ofstream file( &quot;foobar/cheeze&quot; );
file &lt;&lt; &quot;tastes good!\n&quot;;
file.close();
if ( !fs::exists( &quot;foobar/cheeze&quot; ) )
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Something is rotten in foobar\n&quot;;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional class path constructors provide for an operating system dependent 
format, useful for user provided input:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>int main( int argc, char * argv[] ) {
fs::path arg_path( argv[1], fs::native ); // native means use O/S path format</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To make class <i>path</i> objects easy to use in expressions, <i>operator/</i> 
appends paths:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>fs::ifstream file1( arg_path / &quot;foo/bar&quot; );
fs::ifstream file2( arg_path / &quot;foo&quot; / &quot;bar&quot; );</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that expressions <i>arg_path / &quot;foo/bar&quot;</i> and <i>arg_path / &quot;foo&quot; 
/ &quot;bar&quot;</i> yield identical results.</p>
<p><a href="operations.htm#directory_iterator">Class <i>directory_iterator</i></a> 
is an important component of the library. It provides input iterators over the 
contents of a directory, with the value type being class <i>path</i>.</p>
<p>The following function, given a directory path and a file name, recursively 
searches the directory and its sub-directories for the file name, returning a 
bool, and if successful, the path to the file that was found.&nbsp; The code 
below is extracted from a real program, slightly modified for clarity:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>bool find_file( const fs::path &amp; dir_path,     // in this directory,
                const std::string &amp; file_name, // search for this name,
                fs::path &amp; path_found )        // placing path here if found
{
  if ( !fs::exists( dir_path ) ) return false;
  fs::directory_iterator end_itr; // default construction yields past-the-end
  for ( fs::directory_iterator itr( dir_path );
        itr != end_itr;
        ++itr )
  {
    if ( fs::is_directory( *itr ) )
    {
      if ( find_file( *itr, file_name, path_found ) ) return true;
    }
    else if ( itr-&gt;leaf() == file_name ) // see below
    {
      path_found = *itr;
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The expression <i>itr-&gt;leaf() == file_name</i>, in the line commented <i>// 
see below</i>, calls the <i>leaf()</i> function on the <i>path</i> object 
returned by the iterator. <i>leaf()</i> returns a string which is a copy of the 
last (closest to the leaf, farthest from the root) file or directory name in the
<i>path</i> object.</p>
<p>Notice that <i>find_file()</i> does not do explicit error checking, such as 
verifying that the <i>dir_path</i> argument really represents a directory. All 
Filesystem Library functions throw <a href="exception.htm">filesystem_error</a> 
exceptions if they do not complete successfully, so there is enough implicit 
error checking that this application doesn't need to include additional error 
checking code.</p>
<p>The tutorial is now over; hopefully you now are ready to write simple, 
script-like, programs using the Filesystem Library!</p>
<h2><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h2>
<h3>simple_ls.cpp</h3>
<p>The example program <a href="../example/simple_ls.cpp">simple_ls.cpp</a> is 
given a path as a command line argument. Since the command line argument may be 
a relative path, the complete path is determined so that messages displayed 
can be more precise.</p>
<p>The program checks to see if the path exists; if not a message is printed.</p>
<p>If the path identifies a directory, the directory is iterated through, 
printing the name of the entries found, and an indication if they are 
directories. A count of directories and files is updated, and then printed after 
the iteration is complete.</p>
<p>If the path is for a file, a message indicating that is printed.</p>
<p>Try compiling and executing <a href="../example/simple_ls.cpp">simple_ls.cpp</a> 
to see how it works on your system. Try various path arguments to see what 
happens.</p>
<h3>Other examples</h3>
<p>The programs used to generate the Boost regression test status tables use the 
Filesystem Library extensively.&nbsp; See:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../../tools/regression/process_jam_log.cpp">
  process_jam_log.cpp</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../tools/regression/compiler_status.cpp">
  compiler_status.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Test programs are sometimes useful in understanding a library, as they 
illustrate what the developer expected to work and not work. See:</p>

</ul>
<h2><a name="Definitions">Definitions</a></h2>
<p><b><a name="directory">directory</a> </b>- A container provided by the operating system, 
containing the names of files, other directories, or both. Directories are identified 
by <a href="#directory path">directory path</a>.</p>
<p><b><a name="directory_tree">directory tree</a></b> - A directory and file 
hierarchy viewed as an acyclic graph.</p>
<p><b><a name="path">path</a> </b>- A possibly empty sequence of <a href="#name">names</a>. Each 
element in the sequence, except the last, names a <a href="#directory">directory</a> 
which contains the 
next element. The last element may name either a directory or file. The first 
element is closest to the <a href="#root">root</a> of the directory tree, the last element is 
farthest from the root.</p>
<p>It is traditional to represent a path as a string, where each element in the 
path is represented by a <a href="#name">name</a>, and some operating system 
defined syntax distinguishes between the name elements. Other representations of 
a path are possible, such as each name being an element in a <code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><b><a name="file path">file path</a></b> - A <a href="#path">path</a> whose 
last element is a file.</p>
<p><b><a name="directory_path">directory path</a></b> - A <a href="#path">path</a> 
whose last element is a directory.</p>
<p><b><a name="name">name</a></b> - A file or directory name, without any
<a href="#directory path">directory path</a> information to indicate the file or 
directory's actual location within a directory tree. For some 
operating systems, files and directories may have more than one valid name, such 
as a short-form name and a long-form name.</p>
<p><b><a name="root">root</a></b> - The initial node in the acyclic graph which 
represents the <a href="#directory_path">directory tree</a> for a filesystem.</p>
<p><b><a name="multi-root_filesystem">multi-root operating system</a></b> - An 
operating system which has multiple <a href="#root">roots</a>. Some operating systems 
have different <a href="#directory_tree">directory trees</a> for each different 
disk, drive, device, volume, share, or other entity managed the system, with each having its 
own root-name.</p>
<p><b><a name="link">link</a></b> - A&nbsp;name in a <a href="#directory">
directory</a> can be viewed as a pointer to the underlying directory or file 
content. Modern operating systems permit multiple directory elements to point to 
the same underlying directory or file content. Such a pointer is often called a 
link. Not all operating systems support the 
concept of links. Links may be referenced counted or non-reference counted. 
Non-reference counted links are sometimes called symbolic links or shortcuts.</p>
<h2><a name="Common_Specifications">Common Specifications</a></h2>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, all Filesystem Library member and non-member 
functions have the following common specifications:</p>
<p><b>May throw exceptions</b> - Filesystem Library functions may throw <i><a href="exception.htm">filesystem_error</a></i> 
exceptions if they cannot successfully complete their operational 
specifications. Function implementations may use C++ Standard Library functions, 
which may throw <i>std::bad_alloc</i>. These exceptions may be thrown even 
though the error condition leading to the exception is not explicitly specified 
in the function's &quot;Throws&quot; paragraph.</p>
<p><b>Exceptions thrown via <a href="../../utility/throw_exception.html">
boost::throw_exception()</a></b> - All exceptions thrown by the Filesystem 
Library are implemented by calling <a href="../../utility/throw_exception.html">
boost::throw_exception()</a>. Thus exact behavior may differ depending on 
BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS at the time the filesystem source files are compiled.</p>
<p><b>Links follow operating system rules</b>- <a href="#link">Links</a> are 
transparent in that Filesystem Library functions simply follow operating system 
rules. That implies that some functions may throw <i><a href="exception.htm">filesystem_error</a></i> 
exceptions if a link is cyclic or has other problems.</p>
<p>Typical operating systems rules call for deep operations on all links except 
that destructive operations on non-reference counted links are either shallow, 
or fail altogether in the case of trying to remove a non-reference counted link 
to a directory.</p>
<p>Rationale: Follows existing practice (POSIX, Windows, etc.).</p>
<p><b>No atomic-operation or rollback guarantee</b> - Filesystem Library 
functions which throw exceptions may leave the external file system in an 
altered state. It is suggested that implementations provide stronger guarantees 
when possible.</p>
<p>Rationale: Implementors shouldn't be required to provide guarantees which are 
impossible to meet on some operating systems. Implementors should be given 
normative encouragement to provide those guarantees when possible.</p>
<p><b>Graceful degradation</b> -&nbsp; Filesystem Library functions which cannot 
be fully supported on a particular operating system will be partially supported 
if possible. Implementations must document such partial support. Functions which 
are requested to provide some operation which they cannot support should report 
an error at compile time or throw an exception at runtime.</p>
<p>Rationale: Implementations on less-powerful operating systems should provide 
useful functionality if possible, but should not be required to simulate 
features not present in the underlying operating system.</p>
<h2><a name="Race-condition">Race-condition</a> d<a name="Dangers">anger</a></h2>
<p>The state of files and directories is often
globally shared, and thus may be changed unexpectedly by other threads, 
processes, or even other computers having network access to the filesystem. As an 
example of the difficulties this can cause, note that the following asserts 
may fail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>assert( exists( &quot;foo&quot; ) == exists( &quot;foo&quot; ) );&nbsp; // 
(1)<br>
<br>
remove_all( &quot;foo&quot; );<br>
assert( !exists( &quot;foo&quot; ) );&nbsp; // (2)<br>
<br>
assert( is_directory( &quot;foo&quot; ) == is_directory( &quot;foo&quot; ) ); // 
(3)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(1) will fail if a non-existent &quot;foo&quot; comes into existence, or an 
existent &quot;foo&quot; is removed, between the first and second call to <i>exists()</i>. 
This could happen if, during the execution of the example code, another thread, 
process, or computer is also performing operations in the same directory.</p>
<p>(2) will fail if between the call to <i>remove_all()</i> and the call to
<i>exists()</i> a new file or directory named &quot;foo&quot; is created by another 
thread, process, or computer.</p>
<p>(3) will fail if another thread, process, or computer removes an 
existing file &quot;foo&quot; and then creates a directory named &quot;foo&quot;, between the 
example code's two calls to <i>is_directory()</i>.</p>
<p>A program which needs to be robust when operating on potentially-shared file 
or directory resources should be prepared for <i>filesystem_error</i> exceptions 
to be thrown from any filesystem function except those explicitly specified as 
not throwing exceptions.</p>
<h2><a name="Implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>The current implementation (September, 2002) supports operating systems that have 
either the POSIX or Windows API's available.</p>

<p>The Filesystem Library was designed and implemented by Beman Dawes. The <i>directory_iterator</i> and <i>filesystem_error</i> classes were 
based on prior work from Dietmar Kühl, as modified by Jan Langer. Thomas Witt 
was a particular help in later stages of development.</p>

<p>Key <a href="design.htm#Requirements">design requirements</a> and
<a href="design.htm#Realities">design realities</a> were developed during 
extensive discussions on the Boost mailing list, followed by comments on the 
initial implementation. Numerous helpful comments were then received during the
